    Utilizing machine learning to predict the winning team in LoL
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    League of Legends (LoL for short), is a multiplayer online battle arena video game where two teams of five players each battle to destroy the opposite teams base.

    This was a project I worked on utilizing six different machine learning algorithms to compare making predictions of the winning team from a dataset containing over 51K LoL matches.

    This was a fun project learning some different packages in Python which I had never used before.

    I was presented with a huge number of files that were a part of an online database export, which need to be sorted into folders according to the staff member they belong to.
    
    I tackled the problem by writing a script in Python to read from the CSV file which contained all of the user and file data. The script created over 1000 file directories and moved 16,000+ files into the appropriate directories based upon the user they belonged to.

    A data study on various factors that influence a patient not showing for a doctor's appointment.
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
   Utilizing SQL and R, I evaluated various patient and appointment features to determine which played the largest role in a patient missing an appointment. 
   
   The study was performed on over 500K patients and then used to train a Random forest model. This model performed around 91% accuracy in predicting if a future appointment would be missed or not.
   
   Both SQL and R files are available [here.](https://github.com/ericborn/showrate)
