    While I was at a brewery the world series of poker was on tv. Each time a hand was dealt or when cards were turned over, the screen showed the likelyhood each of the players had in winning the hand. I figured this would be pretty easy to write and a fun project to do while learning more about object oriented programming in Python.

    At work I was presented with a huge number of loose files that were a part of an online database export, which need to be sorted into folders according to the staff member they belong to.
    I tackled the problem by writing a script in Python to read from the CSV file which contained all of the user and file data. The script created over 1000 file directories and moved 16,000+ files into the appropriate directories based upon the user they belonged to.

    We have a relatively high no-show rate, so I wanted to put together a data study to attempt to identify what factors a patient may have that indicate whether they will show to a doctor's appointment or not.
