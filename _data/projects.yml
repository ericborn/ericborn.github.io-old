    At work I was presented with a huge number of loose files that were a part of an online database export, which need to be sorted into folders according to the staff member they belong to.
    I tackled the problem by writing a script in Python to read from the CSV file which contained all of the user and file data. The script created over 1000 file directories and moved 16,000+ files into the appropriate directories based upon the user they belonged to.
