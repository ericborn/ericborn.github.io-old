    Utilizing machine learning to predict the winning team in LoL
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    League of Legends (LoL for short), is a multiplayer online battle arena video game where two teams of five players each battle to destroy the opposite teams base.

    This was a project I worked on utilizing various machine learning algorithms to predict the winning team from a dataset containing over 51K matches.

    This was a fun project learning some different packages in Python which I had never used before.

    At work I was presented with a huge number of loose files that were a part of an online database export, which need to be sorted into folders according to the staff member they belong to.
    I tackled the problem by writing a script in Python to read from the CSV file which contained all of the user and file data. The script created over 1000 file directories and moved 16,000+ files into the appropriate directories based upon the user they belonged to.

    A data study on various factors that influence a patient not showing for a doctor's appointment.

   My organization had a relatively high no-show rate, 20-40% of appointments, so I wanted to put together a data study to attempt to identify factors that may indicate whether they would show to a doctor's appointment or not.
   
   Utilizing both SQL and R, I evaluated various factors such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, type of appointment, appointment day of the week and time and the number of days between the creation of appointment and actual appointment date. The study was performed on over 500K patients and the various factors weighted against each other for importance. 

   Once these were determined, a risk model was developed and applied to all future appointment in an attempt to predict how many no-shows there would be and overbook where necessary to keep the clinics at capacity.
