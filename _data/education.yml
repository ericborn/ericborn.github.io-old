    I'm currently enrolled at BU in the MSCIS Data Analytics program. The program covers mathmatics, data analysis, mining and presentation, Python programming, database design and more broad topics like computer networking, IT strategy and Information system analysis and design. It's been a great program so far and I'm excited to continue to learn.

    At the Art Institute I learned the importance of project management, working on tight deadlines and teamwork which have carried forward into my career.
