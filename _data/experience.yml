    During my time at Sony Online Entertainment I worked on multiple AAA game titles providing rigirous testing and bug reporting to the development team. This was a fun environment to work in but was also extremely long hours.

    While enlisted in the US Army I served a tour of duty in Iraq where I helped to convert existing buildings into offices by wiring them for network connectivity. I also worked in a network operations center monitoring network security and operations while providing verbal and written assistance to end-users.
